# EmbeddedJava

The project is a static Java compiler, which compiles a Java code to binary code of microcontrollers with limited resources, based on Cortex-M or MIPS core with Flash and SRAM on chip. 
Also developed a very compact runtime system and convenient IDE for easy integration of Java and C programming in one common project.

There are two different presentations: for MIPS (PIC32 family) and for Intel x86-32 (Curie).
